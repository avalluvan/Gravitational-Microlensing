### Prediction in the 1930's

Deflection angle $\alpha$
| Newtonian Theory            | General Relativity          |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| $\alpha = \frac{2GM}{v^2r}$ | $\alpha = \frac{4GM}{c^2r}$ |

Arthur Eddington validated GR predictions through measurements during a solar eclipse in 1919

### Quasar QSO 0957+561

 - Evidence that this quasar found at $z \sim 1.4$ (?) is a lens was seen from two images separated by $6"$:
   - Lensing galaxy detected at $z \sim 0.36$ (?)
   - Similarity of the spectra of the two images
   - Ratio of optical and radio fluxes are consistent between two images
   - VLBI (?) imaging showed detailed correspondence between small scale features
 - Seen as two objects A and B in the sky, they correspond in the number and properties of the components of the respective models

#### Huchra's Lens

 - Quadruply-images quasar Q2237+0305 aka "Einstein's Cross" $z \sim 1.7$
   - Lensing galaxy is ZW2237+030 "Huchra's Lens" at $z = 0.04$

### Cluster Arcs

 - Giant luminous arcs with very thin radial direction coming from a much higher redshift source than the lens galaxy

### Gravitational Deflection

 - Deflection angle:$$\hat{\alpha} = 2\int\nabla_\perp \Phi \text{ ds}$$ solved geodesic for the photon path
