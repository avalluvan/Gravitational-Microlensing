# Microlensing Project Minutes

- Reproduce the plots in the paper
- Number of GRB events
- Plot more refined calculations
- Intergalactic Scattering Dispersion (?) measures for FRBs
- Multiple observers (from Venus and Earth)
- Explore the effects due to extended sources
- Obtain X-ray sensor parameters
  - Typical radiometric resolution
  - Range of wavelengths
- "Iâ€™m also confused by why the bound changes as a function of f with the separation between the detectors"
- "Also, I remember some paper about going beyond the diffraction limit using quantum optics techniques. Might be something worth exploring" Femtolensing
